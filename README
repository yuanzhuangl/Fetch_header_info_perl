Question:
   Write and submit a Perl program which reads the standard input and prints out content of all header tags,
   such as: <H1>. . . </H1>, <h2>. . . </h2>, and so on. 


Requirments:
  -  It should print out the content of all HTML tags starting with the letter ‘H’ or ‘h’ and followed by one
     or more digits.  
  - The tags should be matched in a case-insensitive way, however when printing, you should always print an
    uppercase ‘H’.
  - You should match only the cases where opening and closing tags are on the same line. 
  - It is possible to have multiple tags in the same line, but you can assume that they do not overlap. 
  - You should also assume that an opening or closing tag may contain additional attributes such as <h4 attr=1>
    but those will not be printed in the output.
  - The program must not print any unspecified output; it should simply read the standard input (using the <> operator), 
    and produce tags and their content in the standard output, one tag per line.
   
Example:

input file:
This is <h1>a test</h1>.
This line has no tags.
<H2>Multiple tags</h2> in a <h3>Line.</h3>
<h4 atr=1>Attributes included</h4>
and <h5a>not this one</h5a>
<h1>so</h1>
<h1 > on.... </H1>


output file:
<H1>a test</H1>
<H2>Multiple tags</H2>
<H3>Line.</H3>
<H4>Attributes included</H4>
<H1>so</H1>
<H1> on.... </H1>
